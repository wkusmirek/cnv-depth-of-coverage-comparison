# cnv-depth-of-coverage-comparison

The repository contains scripts that allow you to recreate the results published in the article: "Different strategies for calculating the depth of coverage in CNVs calling tools". Successively download the test data (.bam and .bai files), calculate the depth of coverage tables with Canoes, CODEX, exomeCopy and ExomeDepth tools and run CNVs callers on the obtained depth of coverage tables.
